    â€‹<h2>Likes and Dislikes</h2>
    <p><p>I really enjoy the aspect of school that involves learning and exploring next areas of research! I take many Advanced Placement classes so this definilty allows me to excel in my reaseach skils and gives me an opportunity to discover my interests. However high school is not a smooth ride. I've endured through some pretty rough bumps in the past three years and I have no doubt I will through my last year. But I enjoy these problems; they have shaped me and will shape my future! I enjoy solving problems, but also enjoy reading books. I've read countless nmber of novels and books. From the autobiography of Malcolm X to the Life and Story of Coretta Scott King I've marveled over the extraordinary individuals that created an everlasting light onto this world. I enjoy fashion and design as well. Taking on the responsibilty of wearing my hijab everyday, I take it as a another form of expression. t exprsses my religion and my relationship with God as wella s allwoing myslef to express my sense of fashion and design. Through the hijab, I've created my own sense of design and what is beautiful to me.   </p>
